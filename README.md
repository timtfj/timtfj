Hello. I'm Tim, and present online as
- <a href="https://twitter.com/timtfj">@timtfj</a>
on Twitter, since 2009.
- <a href="https://mastodon.social/@timtfj">@timtfj@mastodon.social</a> on Mastodon, since Nov. 2022.

Other places I've contributed include Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, and Mathematics StackExchange. My blog is at <a href="https://timtfj.com">timtfj.com</a>.

I'm here primarily so I can submit Mastodon bug reports or feature suggestions, and participate in discussions about them.

However, I've done a reasonable amount of coding in the past, and it's not beyond the bounds of possibility that I'll find myself contributing code to Mastodon at some point.
